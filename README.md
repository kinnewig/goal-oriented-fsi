# goal-oriented-fsi
Goal-oriented posteriori error estimation and mesh adaptivity with a partition-of-unity dual-weighted residual method applied to stationary fluid-structure interaction 

This code is based on www.dealii.org Version 9.1.1. Except UMFPACK (that usually comes as a bundled package), no additional software interfaces are needed.

After downloading these files, you can work with them as in a typical deal.II tutorial step.

A short description can be found at the beginning of the step-fsi.cc file.

Soon, a preprint version of a paper with some more information and some results will be uploaded.

In case you have questions, please let me know.
